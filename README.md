# Introduce

There are many tutorials about computer learning, but there is not a complete enough tutorial when I study.

So with this tutorial, it records the complete path of my self-study of computer. I refer to the learning path of students in the computer department of Fudan University in colleges and universities, list some additional knowledge in my learning process and follow-up work, and recommend the best official documents to you. I will avoid producing crude personal tutorials. Currently, the Chinese document is being updated to English.
